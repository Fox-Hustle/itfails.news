### Overview
In September 2023, digital risk protection company DarkBeam suffered a major security lapse, exposing 3.8 billion records due to a misconfigured Elasticsearch and Kibana interface. This breach not only exposed user emails and passwords from previous data breaches but also highlighted the risks of improper security configurations.

### Impact and Response
The exposure was discovered by a security researcher, who immediately alerted DarkBeam. The company promptly secured the vulnerability, but the incident serves as a critical reminder of the importance of secure configurations and the potential consequences of oversight.

### Lessons Learned
This breach underscores the importance of rigorous security practices, regular security audits, and the need for companies to ensure all systems are properly configured to safeguard sensitive data against unauthorized access.
