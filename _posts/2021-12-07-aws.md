---

### Overview
On December 7, 2021, Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant outage that lasted over six hours. This affected major services globally, including Netflix, Disney+, Slack, and Venmo, among many others, all of which depend on AWS’s cloud infrastructure.

### Technical Details
The outage was triggered by an **automation error** in AWS's internal systems. Specifically, the issue stemmed from the disruption of network device configurations caused by an automated scaling process. This caused multiple system components to behave abnormally, cutting off access to AWS’s core services such as EC2 and Lambda. The outage affected AWS regions in the eastern United States, rippling across a large portion of the internet.

### Impact
- **Service Disruptions**: Popular services like Netflix, Disney+, Slack, and Venmo faced outages, severely disrupting online entertainment, communication, and transactions.
- **Cloud Reliance**: This incident highlighted the vulnerabilities of relying heavily on a few cloud service providers and the far-reaching consequences of such outages.
- **Estimated Losses**: The outage likely cost businesses millions in lost revenue and productivity as global operations stalled for hours.

### Lessons Learned
This outage demonstrates the need for a diversified cloud strategy, ensuring redundancy across multiple regions and providers to avoid single points of failure.
