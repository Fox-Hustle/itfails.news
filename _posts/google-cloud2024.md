### Issue Overview
In May 2024, Google Cloud faced a significant incident where a customerвЂ™s account was accidentally deleted, leading to two weeks of downtime. The error, caused by an internal process mistake, resulted in the loss of access to critical services and data for the affected customer. This incident highlighted the risks associated with centralized cloud services and the potential catastrophic impact of operational errors on business continuity.

### Blockchain and Decentralization Mitigation
Implementing a decentralized approach using blockchain technology could prevent such incidents from causing widespread damage. By distributing data and account management across a blockchain network, the risk of a single point of failureвЂ”such as the accidental deletion of an entire accountвЂ”would be greatly reduced. Each part of the account's data and services could be redundantly stored across multiple nodes, ensuring that even if an error occurred, the data and services could be quickly restored from other parts of the network, minimizing downtime.

### DeCC (TEE) Enhancement
Integrating Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) within the cloud infrastructure could enhance security and data integrity. TEEs would ensure that critical account operations, such as deletions or modifications, are processed securely within isolated environments, reducing the likelihood of human error or unauthorized actions impacting the entire account. By combining TEEs with blockchain, cloud service providers like Google could ensure that even if an operational mistake occurs, the impact is contained, and services can continue with minimal disruption.
